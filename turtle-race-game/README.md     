# 🐢 Turtle Race Game

A fun and interactive turtle-racing game built using Python's `turtle` graphics library.  
Players choose how many turtles (2–10) participate, each assigned a random color. The turtles race upward on the screen, and the winner is announced once one reaches the finish line.



## 🚀 Features

- Choose between **2 and 10 turtles**.
- Randomized turtle colors each game.
- Simple, clean, and interactive terminal input.
- Graphical race animation using Python's built-in `turtle` module.
- Automatically detects and announces the winning turtle.


## 📦 Requirements

This project works with **Python 3.x** and requires no external libraries except the standard library.

Modules used:
- `turtle`
- `random`



## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/turtle-race-game.git
cd turtle-race-game
```
```bash
python turtle_race.py
```
3.Follow the on-screen prompt to choose the number of turtles.

4.Watch the race and see the winner!


### 🧠 How It Works

- The program asks the user how many players (turtles) should race.

- A turtle screen is initialized with the given height and width.

- Turtles are placed evenly spaced at the bottom of the screen.

- Each turtle moves a random distance each frame.

- First turtle to reach the finish line wins.
